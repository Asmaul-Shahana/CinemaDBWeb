# CinemaDBWeb

This is a simple project on fetching data from mysql database in php and creating a webpage where we can insert and view data of the database.
We used cinema db database for this.
The database consists of three relations: movie (mid,mtitle,myear), person (pid,pname,psex,pdob) and role (mid,pid,part).
In our webpage, the homepage has two options, insert and view data. From there we can choose to:
1. View the tables individually in View Cinema page
2. View all tables together in View Cinema page
3.Insert data into the three tables.
